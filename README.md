                                                         ZIION: KALI for Blockchain 

The Blockchain technology has changed since Bitcoin paper was released in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto. Nowadays, blockchain-based technologies are trending. However, it’s considered a new and experimental technology if it is compared to security of traditional IT system. Thus, technology advances rapidly and new vulnerabilities appear.
The three main features of Smart Contracts (transparency, immutability and the ability to represent a value) can also put Smart Contracts security in risk and therefore, being a target for cybercriminals.



"Imagine trying to hack Bank of America— except you can read all of their code in advance, all of their transactions are public, and if you steal the money it’s irreversible. Sounds like a paranoid worst-case scenario? Well, this is exactly the setup Ethereum smart contract developers have to deal with every day." -- Ivan Bogatyy

The largest problem is that the whole code and transactions are public, giving the hacker plenty of time to examine the code, think outside the box, and look for new vulnerabilities. Transactions cannot be reversed.

“Kali Linux is a great tool for pen testers and auditors,” says Halborn co-founder Steve Walbroehl, “but it’s not really equipped for the security needs of blockchain development. That’s why our best-in-class blockchain security engineers at Halborn built ZIION, a true turnkey VM with all the tools needed to securely build and develop in Web3.”
